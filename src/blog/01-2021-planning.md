## Outfit One: Lumberjack Sailor

I can see my new favorite outfit in my mind's eye: it's a light blue denim pea coat with dark navy buttons, a blue buffalo checked flannel shirt, a well-fitting t-shirt, black or grey denim jeans, and my old boots.

It fits me well and I feel good about my style. Femininely-styled clothes don't work for me but I usually have to wear them because they're the things that fit my chest and hips, or I anticipate that people expect me to wear them.

Now that I've been working from home for over a year and into the foreseeable future, I'm a little more free from performing womanhood as others expect. Now that I get to define it, I'll be creating an outfit that fits how I see myself and fits my body.

Let's start at the top and work our way down:

### Chambray Peacoat

I finished 2020 by making [StyleArc's Beatrice Pea Coat](https://www.stylearc.com/shop/sewing-patterns/beatrice-pea-coat/) and didn't have a super fun time with it. It fits ok but the directions were difficult to follow as an intermediate sewist. I turned to a few YouTube videos to figure out how a lining is attached to a coat, and set into a back vent. It's the only pea coat pattern I was able to find that fit a fat body, so I went with it.

I also put in one of my sleeve linings inside out but no one can see that so I'm willing to live with it.

**Pattern**: There's an old Navy surplus peacoat I wore all through high school that doesn't fit now, but is still in my closet. My idea is to take it apart and make a pattern from it, expanding the bodice with a full-bust adjustment, and expanding the biceps.

**Fabric**: [District Fabrics](https://districtfabric.com/), my local fabric shop, had an awesome mid-weight chambray on sale for $7/yd that's a light blue color. Parts of it look sun bleached. I think it'd make for a cool looking jacket, not quite as warm as an actual peacoat but it'd have the same lines, which is what I'm looking for.

### Long-sleeved Flannel Shirt

McCall's has a few unisex patterns that are _almost_ large enough to fit me, and Joann's had a 20% off sale, so I picked up a pattern. It'll need a full-bust adjustment and a size upgrade. I haven't worked with directional patterns before so that'll also be a new challenge.

I often wear unbuttoned long-sleeve shirts, so once I get this pattern into a good place, I'll be able to make quite a few wearable overshirts.

**Pattern**: [McCall's 6613 Unisex Shirts](https://www.palmerpletsch.com/product/mccalls-6613-misses-and-mens-shirt/) by Palmer/Pletsch in a size 28+

**Fabric**: A blue buffalo check from [District Fabrics](https://districtfabric.com/) that was only $8/yd for 100% cotton.

### T-shirt

I've used Seamwork's Jane t-shirt pattern a few times at the beginning of 2020 and they worked out well so I'll be using that again.

**Pattern**: [Seamwork's Jane](https://www.seamwork.com/catalog/jane) in a 3XL

**Fabric**: not purchased yet

### Denim Jeans

Last summer, I took Cashmerette's [Jean Making for Curves](https://workshops.cashmerette.com/p/jeans-making-for-curves/) online course, which was a great class and I highly recommend. I lost steam right around the step of getting the waistband on (since i couldn't find stretch interfacing) so I'd like to give another pair a shot now that I have a better idea of what I need to do.

**Pattern**: [Cashmerette's Ames Jeans](https://www.cashmerette.com/collections/cashmerette-patterns/products/ames-jeans-pdf-pattern) in size 28, straight leg + apple pelvis, thighs lengthened

**Fabric**: I liked the quality and pricing of indigo selvedge denim I ordered from [White Oak](https://whiteoakshop.com/collections/cone-denim-natural-indigo/products/style-p22173-natural-indigo-s-gene-stretch-denim-with-recycled-cotton-and-tencel-10-75-oz?variant=35457771765928), so I may re-order from them or see what my local shop has.
